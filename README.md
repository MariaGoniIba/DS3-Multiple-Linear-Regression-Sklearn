# Data Science (DS) project 3: Multiple Linear Regression using sklearn
Multiple linear regression using sklearn to predict the housing price based on the size and year of the house.

So far, we worked with StatsModels. This time we will work with Scikit-learn (a.k.a. sklearn). This is a Machine Learning package that comes from the SciPy toolkit.

# Credit
The dataset and proposal of the exercise is from the Udemy course [The Data Science Course 2022: Complete Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/). I highly recommend this course for those learning Python and machine learning.

# Analysis of results

Adjusted $R^2$ (0.772) is only slightly lower than $R^2$ (0.776). This means that we were not penalized for the inclusion of 2 variables. 

Note! Those p-values calculated are univariate values reached from simple linear models. They do not reflect the interconnection of the features in this multiple linear regression.
